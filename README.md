# SocialMediaDashboard
A dynamic and interactive Social Media Dashboard built with React. This dashboard displays key metrics from social media accounts (e.g., followers, likes, posts, comments) and allows users to track their social media performance over time. The app is designed with React and provides a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.

This project demonstrates how to fetch data from a mock API and display it in real-time, allowing users to refresh the dashboard manually or automatically.

#Features
Real-Time Data Fetching: Fetch and display key social media metrics.
Interactive UI: Smooth transitions and a responsive design that works across different devices.
Manual and Auto-Refresh: Option to refresh the data either by a button click or automatically at regular intervals.
Dynamic Metrics: Followers, likes, posts, and comments that can be updated in real-time.
Responsive Layout: Designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

#Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS: Custom styling for the dashboard, including hover effects and smooth transitions.
React Icons: Beautiful icons for social media metrics.
API Integration: Mock API to simulate fetching data (you can replace this with real APIs like Twitter, Instagram, etc.).

#How It Works
The app displays key social media metrics such as:

Followers
Likes
Posts
Comments
These metrics are fetched from a mock API (or a live API if integrated), and the dashboard is updated either automatically at regular intervals or through a manual refresh triggered by the user.

#Manual Refresh
The "Refresh Data" button allows the user to trigger a refresh of the metrics, fetching new data from the mock API.
#Auto-Refresh
The data is automatically refreshed every 5 seconds to simulate real-time updates.
